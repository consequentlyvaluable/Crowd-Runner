# Crowd Runner

A lightweight browser mini-game inspired by Crowd Runner / Mob Runner / Count Masters. Guide a squad of soldiers wearing green patches and fire at oncoming enemies in blue patches.

## How to play
- Open `index.html` in your browser (or run `python -m http.server` and visit `http://localhost:8000`).
- Move the squad with **WASD** or **Arrow Keys**.
- Hold **Space** to fire bullets from random squad members.
- Survive waves of enemies while keeping your squad alive.

## Notes
- Enemies spawn faster as your score increases and wave number rises.
- Lose health when an enemy collides with your squad. The game ends when health is gone or all soldiers fall.
